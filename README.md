<br />
An iPhone application to view itineraries before the trip, manage and analyse budgets during the trip, and save the itinerary as a memory collector after the trip.

## Motivation: 
When you are going on a trip with a large group of friends with limited budgets, splitting and keeping track of budget can be time-consuming and tedious. 
Why waste precious time and get unnecessary stress analysing budgets during the trip when you can use budget tracker to manage your budgets?

## Aim:
We aim to provide a trip-aid application where users who have limited time and budgets can utilise to plan a trip of their liking by interacting with other users and viewing their itineraries and budgets before the trip. 

* During the trip, it acts as an expense tracker and budget splitter that handles the tedious task of tracking expenditure of each individual. 

* After the trip, the userâ€™s data is kept in the system such that the application can serve as a memory collector for the user, and a source of inspiration for other users should they choose to share. 

Hence, our application would be useful for all three phases involved for a trip - planning before trip, managing expenditure during trip, keeping record and memory after the trip.

<br />
      
2. The name of the item and the price of the item have to be entered. Then, the name of the person who paid for the item has to be ticked, as well as the trippers who will be sharing the particular item.
	* This function is necessary as this is an aspect of trip budgeting which poses as a problem for many users who experience confusion when having to deal with splitting budgets in a group when not everyone in the group has to pay for a particular item.
	* By having checkboxes to tick off who should be paying for the item added, the financial tracking can be done more efficiently and accurately.

3. Exchange rate function at the add item tab allows for conversion of a sum of money from the chosen base rate and the chosen foreign currency. 
This ensures easy conversion and tracking of expenses when using more than one currency.
